      description: `Hi, my name is Parsa Jiravand. I have been programming for about 4 years.
                    I worked with private start-ups and state-owned companies.
                    I think coding alone is not important, and thinking about the structure to be implemented is more important, so I may spend more hours thinking about coding.
                    I do bodybuilding and my favorite sport is table tennis and I may listen to rock for hours.
                    I love the open source world and helping others.`
